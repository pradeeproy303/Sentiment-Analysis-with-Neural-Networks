# Sentiment Analysis with Neural Networks
In this project, we'll build our own deep learning model to classify the sentiment of messages from StockTwits, a social network for investors and traders.

Our model will be able to predict if any particular message is positive or negative.

From this, we'll be able to generate a signal of the public sentiment for various ticker symbols.
